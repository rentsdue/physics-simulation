# Physics Simulation with Pygame (simulation.py)

## Introduction
This Python script, "simulation.py," is designed to create a basic physics simulation using the Pygame library. It simulates the behavior of falling objects under the influence of gravity and provides a foundation for more complex physics simulations.

## Prerequisites
Before running this script, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:
- Python (version 3 or higher): You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- Pygame: You can install Pygame using pip with the command `pip install pygame`.

## Usage
Follow these steps to run the simulation:
1. Clone or download the "simulation.py" script and save it to a directory of your choice.
2. Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved "simulation.py."
3. Run the script using the Python interpreter:
     ```
     python simulation.py
     ```

4. The Pygame window will appear, displaying the basic physics simulation. In this simulation, a white ball falls due to gravity.
5. To exit the simulation, simply close the Pygame window.


## Customization
You can customize the simulation by modifying the "simulation.py" script. Here are some areas you might want to customize:
- Adjusting the size and properties of objects in the simulation.
- Adding more complex physics interactions, such as collisions or forces.
- Enhancing the graphics and visual elements of the simulation.
